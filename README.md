##  LCA Calculation Methodology

### Circularity Score Components

The circularity score (0-100) is calculated using weighted factors:

- **Recycled Content** (35% weight): Percentage of recycled Metal input
- **Recovery Rate** (25% weight): End-of-life material recovery efficiency
- **Product Life Extension** (20% weight): Durability and reuse potential
- **Scrap Reuse** (10% weight): Manufacturing waste utilization
- **Energy Efficiency** (10% weight): Process energy optimization

### Environmental Impact Categories

1. **Carbon Footprint** (kg CO‚ÇÇ-eq/ton)
2. **Water Usage** (Liters/ton)
3. **Land Disturbance** (m¬≤/ton)
4. **Energy Consumption** (kWh/ton)
5. **Toxic Waste Output** (kg/ton)
